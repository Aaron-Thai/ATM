# Background
This is a demonstration webpage following the playbook included in this repository.

The playbook is a tutorial on how to create your own webpage using AI generated content, such as text, images, and video.

* [Claude AI](https://claude.ai/) was used to generate text.
* [Bing Image create](https://www.bing.com/images/create/) was used to generate images.
* [HourOne](https://hourone.ai/) was used to generate a video using the above sources as inputs.

## Prompts used

**Claude AI** (text prompt):
* "Write me a short paragraph explaining how the ATM is an important service innovation"

**Bing Image create** (image prompt):
* “happy person using an atm”

**HourOne** (video options selected):
* Presenter: Emily (Christmas)
* Voice: Nova (English, US)

The HTML webpage was coded by myself following the playbook.

## How to Host a Website (with VS Code and GitHub)

A demonstration of how to host the website on GitHub Pages as done on this repository could be a good addition to the playbook.
